### Class `DrawableMyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject`

This class is responsible for the visual representation and interactive behavior of objects defined in `MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject`.

---

#### Inheritance

```csharp
public partial class DrawableMyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject : DrawableHitObject<MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject>
```

- Inherits from the generic class `DrawableHitObject<T>`, where `T` is `MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject`.
- `DrawableHitObject` belongs to the framework and handles basic aspects such as rendering and hit/miss logic.

---

#### Constructor

```csharp
public DrawableMyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject(MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject hitObject) : base(hitObject)
{
    Size = new Vector2(40);
    Origin = Anchor.Centre;
    Y = hitObject.Lane * MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield.LANE_HEIGHT;
}
```

- **Parameters:** Receives an instance of `MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject`.
- **Initialized Properties:**
    - Size (`Size`) is set to `40` pixels.
    - The origin (`Origin`) is centered.
    - Vertical position (`Y`) is calculated based on the object's lane (`Lane`) and a constant (`LANE_HEIGHT`) defined in the `Playfield`.

---

#### Attributes

1. **`currentLane` (Bindable):**
    
    ```csharp
    private BindableNumber<int> currentLane;
    ```
    
    - **Description:** Represents the player's current lane as a "bindable" number.
    - Obtained from [[MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield]].

---

#### Methods

1. **`load`**:
    
    ```csharp
    [BackgroundDependencyLoader]
    private void load(MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield playfield, TextureStore textures)
    {
        AddInternal(new Sprite
        {
            RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both,
            Texture = textures.Get("coin"),
        });
        
        currentLane = playfield.CurrentLaneBindable; 
    }
    ```

- **Description:** Loads the necessary resources for the drawable object.
- Adds a sprite to represent the hitobject (using the "coin" texture).


2. **`CheckHit`**:

    ```csharp
    public bool CheckHit(int laneIndex)
    {
        return laneIndex == currentLane; 
    }
    ```

- **Description:** Checks if the provided lane index matches the object's lane. Used to determine if a player hit this specific object.

3. **`Update`**:

    ```csharp
    public void Update()
    {
        // Code for updating animations or other behavior based on game state. 
    }
    ```

- **Description:** Called every frame to update the drawable object's state, such as animating it or checking for collisions.

#### Dependencies and Key References

- **Imported Classes and Frameworks:**
    
    - `osu.Framework.Graphics.Sprite`: Renders sprites.
    - `osu.Framework.Bindables.BindableNumber`: Allows synchronizing data between different parts of the system.
    - `osu.Game.Audio.HitSampleInfo`: Defines sounds associated with interactions.
    - `osu.Game.Rulesets.Objects.Drawables.DrawableHitObject`: Base class for visual objects.
    - `osu.Game.Rulesets.MyCoolWorkingRuleset.UI.MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield`: Provides the lane and design constants. [[MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield]]
- **Relationships:**

    - The texture `coin` and the lane (`Lane`) are essential for the visual design and interaction.
    - Uses `currentLane` to determine if the player hit the object correctly.

---

### How to Extend This Class

1. **Add Custom Animations:**
    
    - For example, rotations or other effects when hit:

        ```csharp
        this.RotateTo(360, 500, Easing.OutQuint);
        ```
2. **Change Sounds (`GetSamples`):**
    
    - Associate different sounds with various object types.
3. **Integrate With New Properties:**
    
    - If you add properties to MyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject (e.g., `ScoreValue`), use them here to modify the visual or auditory feedback.

### Summary

`DrawableMyCoolWorkingRulesetHitObject` connects game logic with its visual and interactive representation. Its current design provides a solid foundation, but you can customize it by adding new visual effects, sounds, or interactions.
