### **Class `MyCoolWorkingRulesetDifficultyCalculator`**

This class is responsible for calculating the difficulty of a map within the context of the ruleset, evaluating its characteristics and how they affect player performance.

---

#### **Inheritance**

```csharp
public class MyCoolWorkingRulesetDifficultyCalculator : DifficultyCalculator
```

- Inherits from `DifficultyCalculator`, a base class that defines how to calculate difficulty attributes in osu!.
- **`DifficultyCalculator`**:
    - Provides methods that need to be implemented to analyze map objects and generate difficulty attributes.

---

#### **Constructor**

```csharp
public MyCoolWorkingRulesetDifficultyCalculator(IRulesetInfo ruleset, IWorkingBeatmap beatmap)
    : base(ruleset, beatmap)
{
}
```

- **Parameters:**
    - `IRulesetInfo ruleset`: Information about the current ruleset.
    - `IWorkingBeatmap beatmap`: Beatmap for which difficulty attributes will be calculated.
- **Initialization:**
    - Calls the base constructor to configure the calculator with the ruleset and map.

---

#### **Main Methods**

1. **`CreateDifficultyAttributes`**:
    
    ```csharp
    protected override DifficultyAttributes CreateDifficultyAttributes(IBeatmap beatmap, Mod[] mods, Skill[] skills, double clockRate)
    {
        return new DifficultyAttributes(mods, 0);
    }
    ```
    
    - **Purpose:**
        - Returns the calculated difficulty attributes for the map.
    - **Details:**
        - Currently returns a generic instance of `DifficultyAttributes` with:
            - `mods`: List of applied mods.
            - `0`: Default value for difficulty (you can customize this value to reflect specific attributes).
    - **Dependencies:**
        - `DifficultyAttributes`: Class that encapsulates attributes such as stars, applied mods, and more.
2. **`CreateDifficultyHitObjects`**:
    
    ```csharp
    protected override IEnumerable<DifficultyHitObject> CreateDifficultyHitObjects(IBeatmap beatmap, double clockRate)
        => Enumerable.Empty<DifficultyHitObject>();
    ```
    
    - **Purpose:**
        - Generates a list of objects that will be used to calculate the map's difficulty.
    - **Details:**
        - Currently returns an empty list (`Enumerable.Empty`), meaning there is no specific analysis of the objects.
    - **Customization:**
        - Implement this function to create `DifficultyHitObject`s based on the map objects.
3. **`CreateSkills`**:
    
    ```csharp
    protected override Skill[] CreateSkills(IBeatmap beatmap, Mod[] mods, double clockRate)
        => Array.Empty<Skill>();
    ```
    
    - **Purpose:**
        - Creates a list of skills (`Skill`) that will be evaluated to determine difficulty.
    - **Details:**
        - Currently returns an empty list (`Array.Empty`).
    - **Customization:**
        - Add instances of classes that extend `Skill` to evaluate specific aspects of the map (e.g., accuracy, speed).

---

#### **Summary**

`MyCoolWorkingRulesetDifficultyCalculator` is the entry point for calculating a map's difficulty. Currently, it is configured to return default values, but it can be extended to include complex calculations based on `HitObjects` and `Skills`.

To customize the calculation:

- Implement specific skills.
- Analyze map objects to evaluate unique characteristics.
- Adjust difficulty attributes to better reflect the player's experience.
