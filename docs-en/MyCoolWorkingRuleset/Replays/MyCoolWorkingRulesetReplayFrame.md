### **Class `MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame`**

This class defines a frame (`frame`) of a replay in the ruleset. Each frame stores information about the actions performed at a specific time in the replay.

---

#### **Inheritance**

```csharp
public class MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame : ReplayFrame
```

- Inherits from `ReplayFrame`, a base class representing a specific instant in time within a replay.
- **`ReplayFrame`:**
    - Provides basic functionalities such as time management and user input handling.

---

#### **Properties**

1. **`Actions`**:
    
    ```csharp
    public List<MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction> Actions = new List<MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction>();
    ```
    
    - **Description:**
        - Contains a list of actions (`MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction`) that were performed during this frame.
    - **Usage:**
        - Used to replay the player's actions at the time corresponding to the frame.

---

#### **Constructor**

```csharp
public MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame(MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction? button = null)
{
    if (button.HasValue)
        Actions.Add(button.Value);
}
```

- **Parameters:**
    - `MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction? button`: Optional action to be added to the frame.
- **Initialization:**
    - If an action (`button`) is provided, it is added to the `Actions` list.

### **How it works in the context of replays**

1. **Replay Creation:**
    
    - During replay generation, multiple instances of `MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame` are created, each representing a specific instant in time.
    - Each frame stores the actions performed at that moment.
2. **Replay Playback:**
    
    - When playing back a replay, the system interprets the frames (`ReplayFrame`) sequentially and replicates the stored actions.

---

### **How to extend this class**

1. **Add more data to the frame:**
    
    - For example, to include the player's position:
        
        ```csharp
        public Vector2 Position { get; set; }
        ```
        
2. **Override the constructor:**
    
    - Add parameters to initialize additional data:
        
        ```csharp
        public MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame(MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction? button = null, Vector2? position = null)
        {
            if (button.HasValue)
                Actions.Add(button.Value);
        
            if (position.HasValue)
                Position = position.Value;
        }
        ```
        
3. **Add custom serialization:**
    
    - If you need to save or load additional data in replays, implement serialization methods.

---

### **Example of Custom Implementation**

If you want to add a position to the frame:

```csharp
public class MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame : ReplayFrame
{
    public List<MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction> Actions = new List<MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction>();
    public Vector2 Position { get; set; }

    public MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame(MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction? button = null, Vector2? position = null)
    {
        if (button.HasValue)
            Actions.Add(button.Value);

        if (position.HasValue)
            Position = position.Value;
    }
}
```

### **Summary**

`MyCoolWorkingRulesetReplayFrame` defines a frame for replays, storing actions performed at a specific time. It is a key component for handling replays in this ruleset.

To customize it:

- Add additional properties, such as the player's position or a special event marker.
- Modify the constructor to initialize more data.
