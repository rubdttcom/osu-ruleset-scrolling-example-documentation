### **Class `MyCoolWorkingRulesetInputManager`**

This class manages player inputs (like keyboard or mouse) in the context of the ruleset. It defines how specific actions are interpreted and mapped.

---

#### **Inheritance**

```csharp
public partial class MyCoolWorkingRulesetInputManager : RulesetInputManager<MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction>
```

- Inherits from `RulesetInputManager<T>`, where `T` is the type of actions specific to this ruleset (`MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction`).
- **`RulesetInputManager`:**
    - Provides infrastructure for handling custom inputs based on specific rules.

---

#### **Constructor**

```csharp
public MyCoolWorkingRulesetInputManager(RulesetInfo ruleset)
    : base(ruleset, 0, SimultaneousBindingMode.Unique)
{
}
```

- **Parameters:**
    - `RulesetInfo ruleset`: Information about the current ruleset.
- **Initialization:**
    - Calls the base constructor with:
        - `ruleset`: Reference to the current ruleset.
        - `0`: Map variant (usually 0 if there are no specific variants).
        - `SimultaneousBindingMode.Unique`: Allows each key to be assigned only to one action.

---

### **Enumeration `MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction`**

Defines the specific actions that players can perform.

```csharp
public enum MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction
{
    [Description("Move up")]
    MoveUp,

    [Description("Move down")]
    MoveDown,
}
```

1. **`MoveUp`**:
    
    - Description: "Move up".
    - Represents the action of moving the character up on the playing field.
2. **`MoveDown`**:
    
    - Description: "Move down".
    - Represents the action of moving the character down on the playing field.

---

### **Action configuration**


- Actions (`MoveUp`, `MoveDown`) are mapped to default keys in the ruleset, as defined in the ruleset's main class (`GetDefaultKeyBindings`).

---

### **Dependencies and references**

1. **Related classes:**
    
    - **`RulesetInputManager<T>`**:
        - Provides the base functionality for handling inputs.
    - **`MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction`**:
        - Enum that defines the specific actions of this ruleset.
2. **Frameworks:**
    
    - **`osu.Framework.Input.Bindings.SimultaneousBindingMode`**:
        - Controls how keys can be associated with multiple actions.
    - **`System.ComponentModel.Description`**:
        - Provides human-readable descriptions for the actions.

---

### **How to extend this class**

1. **Add new actions:**
    
    - For example, add an action to "jump":
        
        ```csharp
        [Description("Jump")]
        Jump,
        ```
        
    - Make sure to map it in `GetDefaultKeyBindings`.
2. **Change the binding mode:**
    
    - Change the `SimultaneousBindingMode` if you need a key to activate multiple actions simultaneously:
        
        ```csharp
        : base(ruleset, 0, SimultaneousBindingMode.All)
        ```
        
3. **Customize default keys:**
    
    - Modify the default mapping in the ruleset's main class:
        
        ```csharp
        public override IEnumerable<KeyBinding> GetDefaultKeyBindings(int variant = 0) => new[]
        {
            new KeyBinding(InputKey.Up, MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction.MoveUp),
            new KeyBinding(InputKey.Down, MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction.MoveDown),
            new KeyBinding(InputKey.Space, MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction.Jump),
        };
        ```

### **Summary**


`MyCoolWorkingRulesetInputManager` acts as the core for processing and mapping player inputs. It relies on the `MyCoolWorkingRulesetAction` enumeration to define specific actions like "Move Up" and "Move Down".

If you want to experiment:

- Add new actions to the enum and test how to integrate them with other parts of the ruleset.
- Change how keys are interpreted to support combinations or simultaneous actions.
