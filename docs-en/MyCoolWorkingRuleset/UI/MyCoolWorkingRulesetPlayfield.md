### **Class `MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield`**

This class defines the visual structure and logic of the playfield where interactive objects are rendered and gameplay mechanics are handled.

---

#### **Inheritance**

```csharp
public partial class MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield : ScrollingPlayfield
```

- Inherits from `ScrollingPlayfield`, which facilitates scrolling objects within a defined space.
- Provides basic functionality for managing scrollable objects, such as:
    - Container for the objects (`HitObjectContainer`).
    - Scroll direction.
    - Synchronization with map timing.

---

#### **Constants**

1. **`LANE_HEIGHT`**:

   ```csharp
   public const float LANE_HEIGHT = 70;
   ```

   - Defines the height of each lane in the playfield.
2. **`LANE_COUNT`**:

   ```csharp
   public const int LANE_COUNT = 6;
   ```

   - Sets the number of available lanes.

---

#### **Properties**

1. **`CurrentLane`**:

   ```csharp
   public BindableInt CurrentLane => mycoolworkingruleset.LanePosition;
   ```

   - **Description:** Represents the currently selected or used lane by the player.
   - **Source:** This information comes from the [[MyCoolWorkingRulesetCharacter]] object.
2. **`mycoolworkingruleset`**:

   ```csharp
   private MyCoolWorkingRulesetCharacter mycoolworkingruleset;
   ```

   - Instance of a custom character ([[MyCoolWorkingRulesetCharacter]]) that interacts with the playfield.

---

#### **Methods**

1. **`load`**:

   ```csharp
   [BackgroundDependencyLoader]
   private void load()
   {
       AddRangeInternal(new Drawable[]
       {
           new LaneContainer
           {
               RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.X,
               AutoSizeAxes = Axes.Y,
               Anchor = Anchor.CentreLeft,
               Origin = Anchor.CentreLeft,
               Child = new Container
               {
                   RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.X,
                   AutoSizeAxes = Axes.Y,
                   Anchor = Anchor.CentreLeft,
                   Origin = Anchor.CentreLeft,
                   Children = new Drawable[]
                   {
                       new Box
                       {
                           RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both,
                           Colour = Color4.Blue,
                       },
                   }
               },
           },
       });
   }
   ```

   - **Description:** Initializes the playfield by adding a `LaneContainer` and other necessary elements.

---

#### **Dependencies and references**

1. **Related classes:**
   - **`ScrollingPlayfield`:** Base class for scrollable playfields.
   - **[[MyCoolWorkingRulesetCharacter]]:** Handles the player's interaction logic with the lanes.
   - **`LaneContainer`:** Manages the visual layout of the lanes.
2. **Frameworks:**
   - **`osu.Framework.Graphics`:** For rendering and organizing visual elements.
   - **`osu.Game.Graphics`:** Provides specific colors and styles.
   - **`osu.Game.Beatmaps.ControlPoints`:** Synchronizes animations with the map's rhythm.

---

### **How to extend this class**

1. **Add custom effects:**
   - For example, animations on the lanes during a perfect hit:

     ```csharp
     public void HighlightLane(int laneIndex)
     {
         var lane = fill.Children[laneIndex];
         lane.FlashColour(Color4.Yellow, 500, Easing.OutQuint);
     }
     ```

2. **Change the playfield design:**
   - Modify `LANE_HEIGHT` and `LANE_COUNT` to adjust lane size and quantity.
   - Change the margins in `load` to customize the layout.
3. **Add interactions with the character:**
   - Use `CurrentLane` to modify the character's position on the playfield.
