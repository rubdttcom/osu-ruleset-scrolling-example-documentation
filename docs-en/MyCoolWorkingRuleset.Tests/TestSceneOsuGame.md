### **`TestSceneOsuGame` Class**

This class is a test scene for the osu! environment, and its purpose is to verify the visual and functional behavior of components related to the ruleset or the game in general.

---

#### **Inheritance**

```csharp
public partial class TestSceneOsuGame : OsuTestScene
```

- Inherits from `OsuTestScene`, a base class provided by osu! for creating visual and functional test scenes.
- **`OsuTestScene`:**
    - Provides a preconfigured environment to perform tests within the osu! framework.
    - Allows adding components and checking their visual or interactive behavior.

---

#### **Main Methods**

1. **`load`**:

    ```csharp
    [BackgroundDependencyLoader]
    private void load()
    {
        Children = new Drawable[]
        {
            new Box
            {
                RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both,
                Colour = Color4.Black,
            },
        };

        AddGame(new OsuGame());
    }
    ```

    - **Decorator:**
        - `[BackgroundDependencyLoader]`: Injects necessary dependencies when loading the scene.
    - **Action:**
        - Sets the visual and functional elements of the scene.
    - **Details:**
        - Adds a black background using a `Box` that occupies the entire available space (`RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both`).
        - Calls `AddGame` to add an instance of `OsuGame` to the test environment.
    - **Dependencies:**
        - `Drawable[]`: Container for visual elements.
        - `Box`: A simple rectangle used as background.

#### **Dependencies and References**

1. **Related Classes:**

    - **`OsuTestScene`:**
        - Base class for creating visual tests in osu!.
    - **`OsuGame`:**
        - Represents the main osu! game that is initialized within the test scene.
    - **`Drawable` and `Box`:**
        - Basic graphical elements used to build the visual interface.

2. **Frameworks:**

    - **`osu.Framework.Graphics`:**
        - Provides tools for working with graphics and visual elements.
    - **`osuTK.Graphics.Color4`:**
        - Defines colors, such as the black color used for the background.

### **How to Extend This Class**

1. **Add More Visual Elements:**

    - For example, text or a button to interact with:

        ```csharp
        Children = new Drawable[]
        {
            new Box
            {
                RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both,
                Colour = Color4.Black,
            },
            new SpriteText
            {
                Text = "Hello osu!",
                Anchor = Anchor.Centre,
                Origin = Anchor.Centre,
                Colour = Color4.White,
            },
        };
        ```

2. **Test a Specific Component:**

    - If you want to verify a component related to your ruleset:

        ```csharp
        Add(new MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield());
        ```

3. **Add Interactivity:**

    - Introduce interactions to test responses to user input.

---

### **Example of a Custom Test**

If you want to verify a playfield (`Playfield`) from your ruleset:

```csharp
[BackgroundDependencyLoader]
private void load()
{
    Children = new Drawable[]
    {
        new Box
        {
            RelativeSizeAxes = Axes.Both,
            Colour = Color4.Black,
        },
        new MyCoolWorkingRulesetPlayfield
        {
            Anchor = Anchor.Centre,
            Origin = Anchor.Centre,
        },
    };
}
```

### **Summary**

`TestSceneOsuGame` is a simple test scene designed to initialize and verify the osu! environment. Its current configuration includes:

- A black background (`Box`).
- A basic instance of `OsuGame`.

You can customize it to test specific components of your ruleset or add interactive and visual elements.
